##Guitar Note Practice##
*a quick script to randomly generate some notes for practice*

Possible additional features:
* Takes sound input (midi, mic, etc) to tell you if you're right or wrong
* Has a sheet music mode
* Maybe make the above features into an android or web app 
   * I don't know if there's anything quite like that and free on the market
